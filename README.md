# British Airways Data Science Virtual Internship Program

This GitHub repository contains a project focused on scraping review data from the web and analyzing it to uncover insights about British Airways airline. The data was collected from the website Skytrax and was cleaned and prepared for analysis.

The analysis includes topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and wordclouds. The results of the analysis were summarized in a single PowerPoint slide, including visualizations and metrics to provide key points.

Additionally, the dataset was prepared for predictive modeling, and a Linear Discriminant Analysis model was trained using pycaret to predict customer bookings.

The model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics.

The findings were summarized in a single PowerPoint slide and submitted in the repository. This project was completed using Python and the Jupyter Notebook provided in the resources section.
